# coder-Challenge
To run the project I'm assuming You already have installed ``docker`` and ``docker-compose``.
If not please check the following links:
* https://docs.docker.com/get-started/#download-and-install-docker-desktop
* https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/

Once you got all setup do the following steps:
# To run backend 
1) get in **backend** folder
2) run ``docker-compose up -d``

# To run frontend
1) get in **frontend** folder
2) run ``index.html`` file in your favorite browser


enjoy it!  ðŸš€
