# coder-Challenge
To run the project I'm assuming You already have installed ``docker`` and ``docker-compose``.
If not please check the following links:
* https://docs.docker.com/get-started/#download-and-install-docker-desktop
* https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/

Once you got all setup do the following steps:
## To run backend 
1) get in **backend** folder
2) run ``docker-compose up -d``

## To run frontend
1) get in **frontend** folder
2) run ``index.html`` file in your favorite browser


## Don't like docker?
If you don't like to use docker, you should install in your device ``nodeJS`` and ``MongoDB``
the only thing that changes is how to run backend, check the following links: 
* https://nodejs.org/es/
* https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/installation/

### To run backend
1) gen in **backend** folder
2) run ``npm i``
3) create ``.env``file and fill in with exactly all variable in ``.env.example``
4) run ``npm run dev`` or run ``npm run build`` then ``run start``
5) If you wanna run test just run ``run test``

enjoy it!  ðŸš€
